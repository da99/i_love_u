Version Control for Objects
==================================

You have 3 choices:
* diffs (objects turned to strings, diff saved to db)
* Saving previous and latest version of object.
* Copy of object + patches/diff: similiar to decentralized version control systems.

Each table can have instructions on which objects and version control style to use.
The instructions are written as `i_love_u` code.
