"This was a secret of mine, because most of my competitors 
not only didn't listen to their users, but they didn't even 
use their own products."
"You only learn where a product needs improvement through 
serious long-term use. Users gain that kind of experience, 
but reviewers and pundits generally do not."

Learning How to Program
-----------------------

You need the right languages and the right approach for you.
How? No idea. Just search online and ask different people
until you find what you are looking for.

Here are a few suggestions:
* [A Scheme Story: High School Computing: The Inside Story](http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html)
  * [Discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4379482)
* [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)

History Trivia
---------

Previous name: The Universal Programming Language. 

I started implementing it as a Ruby gem, [Uni\_Lang](https://github.com/da99/Uni_Lang), 
but I switched entirely to Coffeescript on Node.js. CoffeeScript is a good enough
Ruby.


Why the stupid name?
-------------------

As a practical joke on all overpaid, idiot middle managers telling their 
overlords they will be implementating "the solution with i love u."

Also, people love stupid. People love outrageous. When your goal in life 
is to pro-create in the suburbs, your standards in entertainment are 
toddler-like.

What apps should you create?
----------------------------

The WWW is a set of mediocre technologies on top of the Internet that
prevent you from creating quality apps.
i\_love\_u does not try to overcome the limitations and mediocrity of the WWW/browser.
Instead, it works within those limits and makes it as easy as possible to create
web apps.

The following are not going to be easy to make with i\_love\_u:

* web apps that try to pretend they are desktop apps.  
* Flash apps
* LivelyKernel apps

However, if you stick to apps with the following qualities, you should have fun 
and be productive:

* text and layout
* database
* late-80s game console graphics (due to browser limitation).

To create popular apps, combine the above with any of the following features:

* low-latency feedback
* interaction with a human being
* graphics and layout from people with talent
* scarcity and reward (the basis of competition)

If you want to truly combine the Internet with desktop apps, look into Squeak, Pharos,
or Factor (by Slava Pestov).  Use LivelyKernel, Tweak, or Morphic for ideas on creating a new UI 
system.


What is i\_love\_u (aka The Universal Language)?
-------------------------------

It's not a language.  I don't know what to call
it. However, people love hype over substance/reality. So, as a slave to
the consumer, I use "Universal Language" as the name.  It's suppose to be
more Englishy than [HyperTalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk),
but with an implementation that is simple
enough for anyone to understand. The [Factor language](http://www.factorcode.org/)
(not the platform)
by Slava Pestov proved to me that simplicity and power is not only possible,
but the only way to design anything.  (Apologies to Mr. Pestov
for using his beautiful ideas as inspiration for a ghetto abomination.)

It's the way most people want programming to be:
an extension of how they think.
That is why it looks like a toy: It's meant to be a better HyperTalk, not Smalltalk/Factor.
In other words, it's for people who do not want to program.

If you want more power: 
* [Pharo](http://www.pharo-project.org/) 
* [Factor](http://www.factorcode.org/).

If you want to learn to program, [learn C](http://learncodethehardway.org/) 
AND [Forth](http://www.forth.com/starting-forth/). If you want to avoid
programming and just make interactive web sites, use i\_love\_u.
